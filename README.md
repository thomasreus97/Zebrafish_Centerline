# Zebrafish_Centerline
Code and files for master thesis Thomas Reus

## Main code

### Compute 3D data from camera tracking data
- csv_to_3D.ipynb

### Creating datasets of several 3-point model variables
- 3D_speed_locations_angles.ipynb

### Create spine models 
- Spinefit.ipynb (original 1-fish system, used for 2d and 3d)
- Spinefit_2fish.ipynb (adjusted version for 2 fish system, not usable for 3d)

### Do PCA on models, investigate data
- PCA_lab.ipynb (needs jupyter lab instead of notebook)

## Side stuff

### Investigating 3-point model variables
- 3D_stuff_chaotic.ipynb (before creating datasets)
- 3D_analysis.ipynb (includes some correlation, appendix B)

### Appendix E
- 3D_check.ipynb

### Creating videos
- 3d_video_spine.ipynb (3d spine)
- video_spine_2d.ipynb (2d spine)

### Looking at calibration
- calibration.ipynb
